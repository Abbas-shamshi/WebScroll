        <h1>Storytelling</h1>
        <p>We all 15-20 bunch of people were excited to move into a brand new office where the very idea to rebrand our agency “ACTONATE” triggered. The excitement and desire inspired us to create something in line with the current renovation design of the office in mind, where we tried to achieve symmetry not only on a physical domain but capture online attention too.</p>

        <h1>MORE ELABORATE STORYTELLING</h1>
        <p>Redesigning your company’s brand sounds like a great idea and believe me I was nonetheless excited, even the entire design team. It definitely came to me as an opportunity and challenge both. The more the bigger challenge was it the more I started to feel the pressure just by thinking how big a job it is.</p><div></div><p> Though it did seem like a challenge as I took the lead in rebranding. The ultimate goal of the project was to create a strong and recognizable visual brand identity and maintain consistency. I and my other team member Divyesh had a brainstorming session with the “BOSS” a.k.a. The CEO - Mr. Shoaib Merchant (Actonate) where we discussed out what are his expectations with the Brand. What it should project?</p><div></div><p>My goal was to understand his ideas and sync my ideas and vision, combining, we move forward by on keywords, attributes, colors, typography, shapes and things like that</p>

      <div class="final-p">
        <p>After going through many iterations were I have just shown some few which were selected or to be said, were taking shape as I and others in the team wanted the logo. Finally, I locked down on the icon. The icon symbolizes moving forward, acceleration and strives to achieve all possible goals. Yes, yes! I know why the “dot” or “circle” - the circle completes the logo. The main approach of the company is from start to finish “WE” have your back which symbolizes with a dot which is there at the beginning and of everything “WE” do.</p>

    <div class="container color">
      <h1>Color</h1>
      <div class="final-p">
      <p>Once, we got the right shape for the logo sign, I started exploring color combinations. To maintain synchrony with the previous logo and highlight the “boldness” and “forwardness”, I chose dark grey tones to add more effect to the cut edge in the main icon. Further to show the start and beginning I added red to the effect.</p>

    <h1>TYPEFACE EXPLORATION</h1>
    <div class="final-p">
    <p>To back the boldness and slight roundness of the logo sign, we needed a perfect typeface which sets the motion and balances the whole logo, meaning to find the right font weight, balanced spacing. The better choice was to try and choose some sans serif font families. So that it stands out and becomes workable on every platform be it web or print medium. However, it took some time to find the right choice, but once we did the uniqueness of the logo stood out.</p>

    <h1>Double Checking every Nook &  Cranny</h1>
    <div class="para-box">
    <p>Even though as a designer, you create designs using grids and measurements, this is just to be extra sure that everything is balanced and looks solid. The letters should be equally spaced out, you want the colors changed - do this at this final stage, as we did here as my boss wasn’t happy with the red we chose instead we selected the dark red color for the final version.</p><p> Everyone loves perfection, so why not to give it an extra push and make sure there is nothing untoward left in the final version of the logo. They say measure twice and cut once.</p>
