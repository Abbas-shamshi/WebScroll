        <h1>Storytelling</h1>
        <p>We all 15-20 bunch of people were excited to move into a brand new office where the very idea to rebrand our agency “ACTONATE” triggered. The excitement and desire inspired us to create something in line with the current renovation design of the office in mind, where we tried to achieve symmetry not only on a physical domain but capture online attention too.</p>

        <h1>MORE ELABORATE STORYTELLING</h1>
        <p>Redesigning your company’s brand sounds like a great idea and believe me I was nonetheless excited, even the entire design team. It definitely came to me as an opportunity and challenge both. The more the bigger challenge was it the more I started to feel the pressure just by thinking how big a job it is.<div></div> Though it did seem like a challenge as I took the lead in rebranding. The ultimate goal of the project was to create a strong and recognizable visual brand identity and maintain consistency. I and my other team member Divyesh had a brainstorming session with the “BOSS” a.k.a. The CEO - Mr. Shoaib Merchant (Actonate) where we discussed out what are his expectations with the Brand. What it should project?<div></div>My goal was to understand his ideas and sync my ideas and vision, combining, we move forward by on keywords, attributes, colors, typography, shapes and things like that</p>
